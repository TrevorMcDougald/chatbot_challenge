1. Use plain ol’ Node
2. Unit testing is expected, and I can run the tests using npm test
3. Command to start chat program is npm start
4. Input will come from STDIN
5. Output will go to STDOUT
6. When I run the start command, I should receive a prompt that welcomes me with the
   message “Welcome to Routefusion Chat!”
7. I should then be asked for my username: “What’s your username?”
8. I should then be able to enter my username and then press enter, and then I should
   receive the message “Hello, <username>!”, where <username> is equal to the name
   previously entered.
9. I should then be able to type the message “Hi” and receive the response “Hi, how are
   you?”
10. I should then be able to type in any garbled message and receive the response “Sorry, I
    don’t understand.”
11. I should then be able to type the message “exit” and receive the response “Goodbye,
    <username>!”, followed by the program exiting gracefully.
